chkdsk is a experimental program that displays various statistics regarding an 1802 Elf-OS disk.
Sample output for a two disk system is shown below.  Currenty this program will hang if 2 disk
are not present on the system.  This issue will be resolved once David Madole completes work
on two disk support for Elf-OS
